# Customer Segmentation

This project implements a customer segmentation model using clustering techniques to divide customers into distinct segments based on their behavior and purchasing patterns. The goal is to help businesses understand their customers better, tailor marketing strategies, and improve customer experiences.

## Introduction
Customer segmentation is a crucial task for businesses looking to personalize their marketing strategies and improve customer engagement. By grouping customers based on similar characteristics, businesses can identify patterns, predict future behavior, and create targeted campaigns.

In this project, we apply unsupervised machine learning techniques to segment customers based on various features like demographics, purchasing habits, and behavior.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is from [source name or dataset repository]. It contains information about customer purchases, demographic data, and engagement metrics. The key features include:

- `Age`
- `Annual Income`
- `Spending Score`
- (Additional features here)

The dataset is pre-processed to handle missing values, standardize numerical features, and create derived features for segmentation.

## Methods
For this project, we use the following techniques to segment the customers:

1. **K-means Clustering**: A popular clustering algorithm that partitions the data into K distinct clusters based on feature similarity.
2. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: A dimensionality reduction technique used to visualize and understand the structure of high-dimensional data.
3. **Silhouette Analysis**: Used to evaluate the quality of clustering and determine the optimal number of clusters.
   
### Clustering Process:
- Pre-process data by handling missing values and scaling features.
- Apply K-means algorithm to generate clusters.
- Analyze the clusters to interpret the characteristics of each segment.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hovogrig/CustomerSegmentation.git
   cd CustomerSegmentation
   ```

2. Install required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the notebook to perform customer segmentation:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook CustomerSegmentation.ipynb
   ```

   The notebook contains detailed steps for data loading, pre-processing, segmentation, and results interpretation.

## Results
The customer segmentation model provides insights into customer groups with different purchasing behaviors. A sample of the results includes:

- Cluster 1: High income, low spending
- Cluster 2: Young customers with moderate spending
- Cluster 3: High spenders with diverse purchasing patterns

The visualization tools (e.g., PCA scatter plots, cluster centers) help interpret and present the results.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
- jupyter

You can install the dependencies using the provided `requirements.txt` file.

## Conclusion
Customer segmentation is a powerful technique for businesses to understand their audience. By leveraging clustering methods like K-means, companies can gain valuable insights and make data-driven decisions. Future improvements include using advanced techniques like DBSCAN or hierarchical clustering and incorporating more features into the dataset.
